## Description

*To be updated*

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Frontend: React + Vite
* Backend: .Net Core 8
* Database: MongoDb

### Installing

Since it's a monorepo, you will need to install/restore packages in each respective project: frontend and backend. Also a local db connection is used for the time being, so you might want to have it in place before running the project.
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../backend
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Executing program

Run each respective project:
```
dotnet run
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```
